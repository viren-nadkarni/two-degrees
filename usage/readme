This folder contains scripts that work with Rasperry Pi to fetch current readings.
During demo, a USB audio card connected to an induction coil was used to take readings.
The analogue signals were fft'd to obtain the digital readings. These readings are then
served to the app through web sockets.

    current.py      # script to test raspi readings
    live_data.py    # script to read and serve raspi readings
    mock_data.py    # script to serve mock readings
