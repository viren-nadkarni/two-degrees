Climate change is one of the critical challenges of the 21st century. At the Paris climate conference (COP21) in November-December 2015, 195 countries adopted the first-ever universal, legally binding global climate deal. In order to transform the way we treat our environment and our planet, citizen engagement in climate change initiatives is very important.

In line with the Semicolons 2016 theme of Digital Transformation, we decided address this global challenge and bring disruptive innovation to the area of tackling climate change. We built two° - a citizen engagement platform for climate change, leveraging Internet of Things (IoT), Blockchain and Gamification.

two° utilizes the capabilities IoT offers and uses sensors to collect data on consumption of resources by citizens who sign-up for individual climate change goals to help achieve their country’s commitment at the Paris accord. Blockchain tracks the actual usage and achievement of goals in a secure, distributed and highly-scalable manner, using the concept of smart contracts. And, Gamification rewards the citizens for achieving goals with virtual currency.

Competing with 33 teams from 8 different locations globally, our platform won the top spot as well as 'Most Innovative Solution' award at Semicolons 2016.

running two°
------------
two° has several components:
- Ethereum, a distributed blockchain which stores all the data and handles the smart contracts
- Raspberry Pi connected to a smart sensor. Ideally, two° will hook on to smart meters (electricity grid, cars, etc.) to measure daily usage and push it as transactions to blockchain.
- A companion app to monitor usage and to set goals
- A web dash for getting detailed statistics and records
